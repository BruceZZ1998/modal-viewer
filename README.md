# Image Modal Viewer Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to view images in a modal on the target website, instead of following the image's link. This README will guide you on how to install and use this extension.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Project**:

2. **Open Chrome**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. **Enable Developer Mode**: There should be a toggle/switch in the top-right corner of the `chrome://extensions/` page. Make sure it's turned on.

4. **Load Unpacked Extension**: Click on the `Load unpacked` button, which should now be visible after enabling Developer Mode.

5. **Choose the Repo**: Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and select it.

## Usage

1. **Go to the Target Website**: Navigate to the website where you want to use the extension.

2. **Pin the Extension**: In Chrome's toolbar, you might see the extension icon. If not, click on the extensions icon (usually a puzzle piece) in the toolbar to reveal a dropdown with all your extensions. Find "Image Modal Viewer" and click the pin icon to pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

3. **Enjoy**: Now, every time you click on an image link on the target website, instead of following the link, you'll see the image in a modal.
